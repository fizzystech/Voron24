# BTT Pi TFT50 for Voron 2.4

Here is the BTT Pi TFT50 screen mount I created (was initially designed for the Switchwire). I have modified the Voron 2.4 front middle front grill for this screen mount. What yous see in my picture is a little different (modified the grill to make it easier to mount to the 2.4 frame).
